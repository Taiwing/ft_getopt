# ft_getopt

Implementation of getopt in C. Handle arguments for unix programs. Is a weird
mix of the GNU and macos implementation. It handles everything pretty much like
the GNU version, except errors where it is close to the mac version. Except
that it lists possibilities when confronted with ambiguous long options. It
also handles the '-' and '+' flags in optstring like the GNU version.

One of the differences with the standard getopt implementation is that it is
reentrant and thread-safe by default, the only drawback being that it needs an
init function.
